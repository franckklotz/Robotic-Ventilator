Hello,
with key people in robotics and Software development, a MD, and a MD Student, we decided to work on a Ventilator since the Covid-19 crisis.

After few idea, we decided tu use an existing Manual Ventilator, AMBU ( see web site ) and control the flow using a stepper motor to precisely control air flow, volume, cylce per minute.

Thanks to Paulo Arruda and Patrick Schmitt to have "worked" some late night on brainstorming this idea.
