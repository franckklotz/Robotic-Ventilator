# Project overview

Hello,
with key people in robotics and Software development, a MD, and a MD Student, we decided to work on a Ventilator since the Covid-19 crisis.

After few idea, we decided tu use an existing Manual Ventilator, AMBU ( see web site ) and control the flow using a stepper motor to precisely control air flow, volume, cylce per minute.

Thanks to Paulo Arruda and Patrick Schmitt to have "worked" some late night on brainstorming this idea / concept.

Since we worked together in multiple indutrial robotic project, we called it Robotic repirator team.

We also participate to the https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/code-life-challenge?lang=en as Robotic Team.

unfortunately, we could not get all parts to have a working prototype as per 31 march 2020, so we decided to share openly our idea so we can continu to build and improve around the community.
