# Project overview

Hello,

with key people in robotics design and Software development, a MD, and a MD Student, we decided to work on a Ventilator since the Covid-19 crisis.

Since we worked together in multiple indutrial robotic project, we called it Robotic repirator team.

We also participate to the https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/code-life-challenge?lang=en as Robotic Team. this was a challenge to design a ventilator in a few days .

After few idea, we decided tu use an existing Manual Ventilator, AMBU ( see web site ) and control the flow using a stepper motor to precisely control air flow, volume, cylce per minute. The design can be adapted to similar AMBU compatible manual ventilator to "automate" the process of ventilating.

Thanks to Paulo Arruda and Patrick Schmitt to have "worked" some late night on brainstorming this idea / concept.

unfortunately, we could not get all parts to have a working prototype as per 31 march 2020, so we decided to share openly our idea so we can continu to build and improve around the community.

So please feel free to get inspired from this proposal and do not hesitate to improve.

# Mechanical parts

The complete 3D parts and assembly is available in the specific folder. 
It was designed with Solidworks.

you can download a free viewer, edrawing to see the design.

the free viewer will allow you to hide parts ( like cover ) or make some parts transparent, and of course zoom in out, rotate and basic navigation around the mechanical design.
